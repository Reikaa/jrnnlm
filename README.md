RNNLM implementation in JAVA
--

Recurrent neural network implementation in JAVA.

The code is refactored for simplicity and extensibility.

Current version:
- No class support
- No direct connection support
- Fully compatible with CRNNLM made by Mikolov
 - With same initial synapse weights, JRNNLM can produce same results
